This documents provide instructions on how to contribute documents to our developer wiki hosted on GitHub.

One of the drawbacks of using GitHub wiki is that only accounts with push privilege can contribute contents. This means if you're not in our core commit team, you can't directly modify the Wiki using the built-in GitHub UI.

However, if you're comfortable using Git and GitHub flavored markdown syntax, we have a separate repository for our wiki. The workflow will be as follows:

1. Clone and fork our [Wiki repo](https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce-Wiki)
2. [Create an issue ticket](https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce-Wiki/issues) and describe how you want to modify the wiki and why
3. Make changes on your fork, and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
4. We'll review the pull request and merge it back to our public repo, and sync the changes to our Wiki.
