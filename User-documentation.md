Our user documentation currently resides at http://docs.getshopped.org.

If you're interested in contributing contents to that site, the workflow will be as follows:

1. Make sure you've already [registered for an account](http://docs.getshopped.org/wp-register.php).
2. Create a ticket on [our GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/wp-e-commerce/issues), explaining how and why you'd like to modify the user documentation.
3. We'll review your ticket and will grant your account write privilege to specific topics so that you can modify those yourself on docs.getshopped.org. Or if the change is minor, you won't have to lift a finger, we'll do it for you.
